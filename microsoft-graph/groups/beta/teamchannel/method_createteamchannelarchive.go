// CreateTeamChannelArchive - Invoke action archive. Archive a channel in a team. When a channel is archived, users
// can't send new messages or react to existing messages in the channel, edit the channel settings, or make other
// changes to the channel. You can delete an archived channel or add and remove members from it. If you archive a team,
// its channels are also archived. Archiving is an asynchronous operation; a channel is archived after the asynchronous
// archiving operation completes successfully, which might occur after the response returns. A channel without an owner
// or that belongs to a group that has no owner, can't be archived. To restore a channel from its archived state, use
// the channel: unarchive method. A channel canâ€™t be archived or unarchived if its team is archived.
