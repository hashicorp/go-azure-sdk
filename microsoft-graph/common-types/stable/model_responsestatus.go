	// The response type. Possible values are: none, organizer, tentativelyAccepted, accepted, declined, notResponded.To
	// differentiate between none and notResponded: none – from organizer's perspective. This value is used when the
	// status of an attendee/participant is reported to the organizer of a meeting. notResponded – from attendee's
	// perspective. Indicates the attendee has not responded to the meeting request. Clients can treat notResponded == none.
	// As an example, if attendee Alex hasn't responded to a meeting request, getting Alex' response status for that event
	// in Alex' calendar returns notResponded. Getting Alex' response from the calendar of any other attendee or the
	// organizer's returns none. Getting the organizer's response for the event in anybody's calendar also returns none.
